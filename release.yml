1. Install the semantic-release on your local environment:
    npm install --save-dev semantic-release

2. Create a config file (release.config.js) in the project with the contents below:
     release.config.js


     module.exports = {
       branches: "master",
       repositoryUrl: ""https://github.com/Kenmakhanu/workflows.git","
       plugins: [
           '@semantic-release/commit-analyzer',
           '@semantic-release/release-notes-generator',
           '@semantic-release/github']
     }

3. Add your project to the repo:
       git add .

4. Commit your project to the repo using conventional commits. Your commit messages should start with:

    fix:                  ......for a patch version
    feat:                 ......for a minor version
    BREAKING CHANGE:      .......for a major version

4. Add step in the CI workflow:


     name: release workflow
     on:
        workflow_dispatch:


     - name: Create a release
       if: github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
       run: npx semantic-release
       env:
         GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}

5. After the code is pushed to the repo, trigger this workflow manually to publish and create a release version.
